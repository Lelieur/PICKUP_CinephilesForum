## ⌨️ **Project Description**  
**PICKUP** is a full-stack web application developed by **Lucas Lelieur** and **Aaron Ferrer** as part of the Ironhack Web Development Bootcamp. The platform enables users to share movie reviews and discover insights from other film lovers in a clean, user-friendly environment.

It includes a **secure authentication system based on JSON Web Tokens (JWT)** and allows authenticated users to create, edit, and manage their own reviews. Built following the **MERN stack architecture**, this project combines front-end interactivity with a robust backend and dynamic database management.
